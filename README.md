## ðŸš€ Getting Started

- Add this package to your `pubspec.yaml`.
- Follow the setup instructions below.

---

## Usage


## Add below code in your **main.dart**
To get your appCollectionId,id,accessToken,appAccessToken Visit https://analytics.pulsecode.in, and register.
```dart
await GraphAnalytics.init(
    appCollectionId: "66614634-------491016ebc",
    id: "66608f1c-------9e5c11be8",
    accessToken:
    "W5qdrn61WUpZ3c0K0---------7BOaL83VswHCtOqxih7tUHhuc9z4VduYlGxGX",
    appAccessToken:
    "e5MA5hW0XCUCeBe15fKAaKdQHL---------JTMA5z5ZqkvGZF7M0QEbyDuLJb",
);
```


## You can log the navigation.
To log navigation, provide both the from and to screen names.

For example, if you're navigating from the login screen to the home screen on a button tap, place the logging code just before **Navigator.push()**
```dart
GraphAnalytics.logNavigation(from: "splashScreen",to: "homeScreen");
```

## You can log the method.
You can track specific user interactions within a screen, such as button taps, text input, etc. Ensure that the screenName used here matches the one provided in logNavigation. Note: If the screen name is not logged using logNavigation, interaction tracking will not function.

Note: The screen name below should be as part of the logNavigation above

```dart
GraphAnalytics.logScreenInfo(screenName: "homeScreen", methodName: "buttonTapped");
GraphAnalytics.logScreenInfo(screenName: "homeScreen", methodName: "searchTapped");
```

Example use cases:

- OTP screen: `resendTapped`, `wrongOtpEntered`
- Profile screen: `termsClicked`, `logoutTapped`
